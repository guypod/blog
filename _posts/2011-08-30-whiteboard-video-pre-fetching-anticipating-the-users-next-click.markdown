In this video we will cover the basics and more advanced aspects of pre-fetching pages or resources for near instantaneous load times.

 We will cover the three main types of pre-fetching:

- Next Page
- Post Load
- Pre Load

As well as the most common issues and challenges associated with this performance optimization.
