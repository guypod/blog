Last saturday I had the honor of writing a [guest post](http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2011/why-inlining-everything-is-not-the-answer/) in the great [Performance Calendar](http://calendar.perfplanet.com), a part of Planet Performance ([@perfplanet](https://twitter.com/#!/perfplanet)), and run by Stoyan Stefanov and Sergey Chernyshev.

The post deals with the common mistake of thinking reducing requests is all that matters, and shows various examples where it will actually slow down your site.

[Click here](http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2011/why-inlining-everything-is-not-the-answer/) to see the full post. I would strongly recommend reading the other posts on that site, and checking back in for a future one – it’s full of performance goodies.
