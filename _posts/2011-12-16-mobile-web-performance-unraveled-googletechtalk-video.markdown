In the last few months I’ve been giving several presentations about Mobile Web Performance in various venues such as Walmart, Time and others. I also had the honor of giving this presentation as a Google Tech Talk, and the google team recorded a video of this presentation.

The video is now up you can watch it below, and you can also read the blog post in the Google Code blog here:
