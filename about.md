Hello, my name is Gal, and I’m a mommy of two young children. I also have a Ph.D. in child development, and I’m a researcher of child development. Many people who hear that say something to the effect that I’m a “professional mommy”. I wish. The first thing I learned from having two kids? No amount of reading will get you even remotely prepared for this journey. The second thing was to always have wipes handy.

In this blog, I will discuss parenting issues from a researcher’s point of view, and developmental issues from a parent’s point of view. Most of my posts contain at least one story about my kid(s) or my experiences as a parent, and at least one piece of empirical evidence to a point I’m making. The idea is to combine here the science of development with the work done “in the trenches” of raising kids.

So welcome, and I hope you enjoy the reading!
