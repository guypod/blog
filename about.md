I'm Guy Podjarny (Guypo), CEO & cofounder at [Snyk](https://snyk.io/), where we deal with the security risk your open source dependencies introduce. I'm passionate about making a better web and do so through speaking, writing and building tools, mostly on the topics of Web Security, Web Performance and Responsive Web Design (RWD).

Before Snyk, I was the CTO of Akamaiâ€™s Web Performance business, following its acquisition of my startup, [Blaze](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/about/news/press/2012-press/akamai-acquires-blaze.jsp). Before that I built Web Application Security products, including the first [Web App Firewall (AppShield)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_firewall#History), [Dynamic Application Security Testing](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/dynamic-application-security-testing-dast) tool ([AppScan](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/appscan)) and [Static Application Security Testing](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/static-application-security-testing-sast/) tool ([AppScan Dev Edition](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/08/0916_podjarny/)).

Other random facts: I have [18 patents](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guypo#background-patents) related to security and performance; am the author of "[Responsive & Fast](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034667.do)" and "[High Performance Images](https://community.akamai.com/docs/DOC-4088?sr=stream&ru=9088)"; created [Mobitest](http://mobitest.akamai.com), an [open-source](https://github.com/guypod/mobitest-agent) mobile web performance testing tool; am on the programming committee of the [Velocity conference](http://velocityconf.com); and am a [startup advisor/mentor/investor](https://angel.co/guypod).
