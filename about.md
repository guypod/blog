I'm Guy Podjarny, or Guypo for short. I'm passionate about making a better web, and spend much of my time researching, educating and building tools to help improve web performance and security. I focus primarily on Mobile web performance and Responsive Web Design, and my research often includes running large scale tests or digging into the internals of how browsers work.

I'm the author of [Mobitest](http://mobitest.akamai.com), an [open-source](https://github.com/guypod/mobitest-agent) mobile web performance testing tool, am on the programming committee of the [Velocity conference](http://velocityconf.com). I'm also the author of "[Responsive & Fast](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034667.do)", a short book about RWD Performance.

I'm currently the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Akamaiâ€™s Web Performance business. Before Akamai I the co-founder and CTO of Blaze.io, which was acquired by Akamai in 2012. Before that I spent over a decade working on Web Application Security, and more specifically the first Web App Firewall (AppShield) and the market leading Web Application Security scanner (AppScan).
